This is my project

PokemonColosseum.py imports the folowing:

**import csv

import ast

import random

from pokemonGame.Pokemon import Pokemon, MoveProperties**

# You MUST use my updated moves-data.csv file in order for my game to work properly.
# You MUST input chosen moves like: ['Dig'].
# The moves have to be in the above format

Steps to run:
1. open with PyCharm
2. navigate to PokemonColosseum.py
3. Press the green arrow in the top right corner to run

Everything works as expected

Thanks
